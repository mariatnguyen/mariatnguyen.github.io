You were there for me when all I knew was "Hello World."

I've used debugger().

I've used console.error().

I've set breakpoints. 

I've used linters, formatters, and more.

Don't get me wrong.

There are lots of tools that I've grown to use, and still stick with.

But when I wasn't ready to publish my code,

you were always there for me.

Test after test. 

You proved to be the best.

You're there for me on Firefox, Safari, Chrome.

Showing me what was right in a calm tone.

When something was wrong,

you'd present me a small icon,

with feedback in red. 

You're so simple,

yet so powerful.

I come back to you,

long after logging messages was all I knew.
